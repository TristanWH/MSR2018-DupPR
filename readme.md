## The *DupPR* dataset


### About this dataset

This dataset includes a list of ***accidentally duplicate*** pull requests collected from GitHub, which can be seen in [dup_prs.md](dup_prs.md).




### How can I help?

You would be appreciated if you can open an issue/pull-request to 

-  add new duplicates you have found
-  point out the errors in the dataset

Attention: please do not submit duplicate issue/pull-request :)
